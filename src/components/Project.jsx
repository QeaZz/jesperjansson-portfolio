                     It was built in JavaScript in the React framework. 
                     The MeteorJS platform was used to create the application and host it. 
                     This and overview of the process with some of the results. Directly under you will find the final UI results.`,

                     Under you can have an overview of how some of the methods used looked like.`,
                  `After collection feedback from literature, users from different methods, we came up with a design in Figma. 
                     This design was made to improve the concept of collaboration within the application and the focus was not to make it look as good as possible.
                     Under is the final Figma sketches that was created.`,
                  `With the design ready in Figma, we tested it out on users and got feedback through observation and a questionnaire.
                     During the early iterations we redesgined the collaborative parts.
                     But for the final design we tweeked a little in production to make it slightly more userfriendly from the results user testing.`,
                  `To finish of I wanted to show the final result in the form of the graphs we got from our hedonic vs pragmatic evalutaion. 
                     The result also included 8 guidelines.

                    They would also be provided with additional information about the plant in order to understand and learn about it. 
                    The idea was that it in the end would hopefully allow inexperienced people to feel more comfortable with bringing home a plant and take care of it. 
                    Studies have shown that taking care of a plant have positive mental health effects. 
                    Thus, if we can inspire more people to get their own plants, we can increase the happiness among users.`,
                  `We desided to move on with only two ideas. 
                    The idea we desided to drop was the Minimalistic Plant Recognizer as it was the least advanced and least creative one, out of the three. 
                    We were also more interested in how the other two would turn out after some more work.`,
                  `We came to the decision that even if the Prototype 2 was harder to implement and more time consuming, it would be worth it as is will become a cooler end product.
                    You can now see the wireflow and design system of the final prototype.`,
                  `To start with, have we accomplished what we wanted to? 
                    I would say that we have, we have created an application that fulfills our initial goals of providing a tool that is supposed to give the user all the necessary information about how to best take care of their plants and flowers. 
                    And that they will also be provided with additional information about the plant in order to understand and learn about it. 
                    We have used design methods to find out what users wants as well as to come up with a design that is consistent.`,
                  `Of course there are room for inprovement, especially in the design of the application itself. 
                    The final design of the app was made in a short amount of time and could be improved.
